            <h3 class="book-name">Legend</h3>
            <p class="book-description">One of my favorite dystopian books. 
                There's always enough tension in the storyline that you 
                don't want to put it down - basically a more thriller version 
                of "1984" with teen protagonists. It has an action based plot with plenty of twists and
                a sprinkle of mystery.

            <h3 class="book-name-xl">How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
            <p class="book-description">An original dragon and viking saga with plenty of humor and wit.
                It has suprising depth, and the character development is top-notch. By the end, you'll find yourself thoroughly
                invested in the protagonists. And yes, I think the books are better than the movies, haha.

            <h3 class="book-name">Ready Player One</h3>
            <p class="book-description">This is one of my favorites because of how the 
                fictional world protrayed is such a possibility in our future. It’s set in 
                the dystopian future of 2044 – oil has run out, the climate is a wreck,
                and the only escape from the daily drudgery is full immersion in 
                the hyper-realistic virtual world.

            <h3 class="book-name">The Martian</h3>
            <p class="book-description">After an exploratory mission to Mars goes awry, 
                a lone astronaut relies on wits and willpower to survive. I enjoyed it for
                its unique style; psychological and a bit geeky with dynamics based 
                largely on existing technology (no aliens).

            <h3 class="book-name">Dark Matter</h3>
            <p class="book-description">A man gets abruptly separated from his family and all 
                that he knows. An existential journey that does a 
                great job of combining sci-fi and reality. Even though it's fiction, 
                it makes you think about life in a differant way. 
                I saw the world with new eyes by the time I finished.
