            <h3 class="book-name">Nausea</h3>
            <p class="book-description">This is a thought-provoking "deep" novel. 
                It's not intended to be a fast-paced, plot-heavy novel,
                it's intended to make you think. You take the perspective of a man
                just going about his life, and yet having the courage to ask the 
                deepest questions. I found it beautiful and freeing.

            <h3 class="book-name">Me Before You</h3>
            <p class="book-description">The main focus of this book is about life
                and the importance of choices. It's much more than a skin-deep
                romcom, in fact it has a rather subtle romantic arc. The storyline 
                is well thought out and made me feel all the emotions (of which 
                there were many) without seeming to try too hard.
            </p>

            <h3 class="book-name">Anxious People</h3>
            <p class="book-description">This book impressed me. It has an 
                interesting plot and feels like a thriller, but is about humanity - the ugly 
                sides and the hopefulness. Full of relatable, introspective quotes
                you'll remember for a long time, but also never venturing into preachy 
                life advice territory.

            <h3 class="book-name-xl">Words On Bathroom Walls</h3>
            <p class="book-description">Follow a teen boy with schizophrenia who 
                struggles to live a normal life while dealing with family issues 
                and high school. An honest and relatable read depicting what 
                it's like to live with mental illness. It's written like journal 
                entries, which gives it a trustworthy and personal touch.

            <h3 class="book-name-xxl">How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</h3>
            <p class="book-description">An incisive, moving novel that follows
                our character's development and tells a coming-of-age story even 
                as it parodies a self-help book. It illuminates the inner 
                turmoil of its protagonist while simultaneously revealing truths about social issues.
